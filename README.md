# PyChat

A simple chat client interfacing with OPENAI's completion API.

## TODO:
1. Handle detection of OPENAI_API_KEY availability
2. `max_tokens` can be set as a parameter outside with a default value of 4000
3. Empty input from user. Suggested to use try expect
4. `engine` can be set as a parameter with a default of "text-davinci-003"
5. `choices` should be checked if we actually have values

## Additional Features:
1. Put code in while loop so you won't have to rerun the program
